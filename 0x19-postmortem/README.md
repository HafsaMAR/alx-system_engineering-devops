# The Great Web Tango: A Postmortem Unveiling
## Issue Summary:
- Duration: January 15, 2024, 10:00 AM - 12:30 PM (UTC) - Because web outage don’t respect your coffee break.
- Impact: The web service went on a coffee break too, leading to a 20% decline in user accessibility.
- Root cause: The real culprit? Our load balancer moonlighting as a DJ and playing the wrong tunes.

## Timeline:
- Detection time: January 15, 2024, 10:00 AM (UTC) - When error rates hit the dance floor and our monitoring system screamed, "Abort! Abort!"
- Detection method: A surge in error rates triggered automated monitoring alerts
- Actions taken: 
    - Engineers embarked on an Indiana Jones-style adventure into the catacombs of our system.
    - Initial assumptions: Did the database eat too much data for breakfast.
- Misleading paths: 
    - We briefly flirted with the idea that our firewall was moonlighting as a DJ too. It wasn’t - just a side effect of too many late-night parties in the server room.
    - We considered blaming aliens, but they had an alibi, so we had to focus on the load balancer.
- Escalation: 
    - DevOps heroes were summoned to the scene like caped crusaders, swiftly followed by the CTO swooping in to save the day.
    - The severity led to further escalation to the CTO for strategic decision-making
- Resolution:
    - Load balancer misconfigured was identified as the root cause.
    - Immediate correction of load balancer settings resolved the issue
## Root cause and resolution:
- Root cause Explanation:
    - An engineer accidentally gave the load balancer a new career as a DJ, causing traffic chaos on the web dance floor.
    - Misconfiguration led to uneven distribution of traffic, turning our load balancer into a party crasher instead of a crowd pleaser.
- Resolution Details:
    - Load balancer settings were reverted to their previous state.
    - Configuration management protocols were revised to prevent future accidental misconfigurations.
## Corrective and Preventive Measures:
- Improvements/Fixes:
    - Strengthen monitoring systems to provide quicker alerts for load balancer anomalies.
    - Implement regular audits of critical infrastructure settings to identify potential misconfigurations proactively.
- Tasks to Address the issue:
    - Conduct a comprehensive review of recent code deployments to access potential interactions with the load balancer.
    - Enhance collaboration and communication channels between development and operations teams to prevent similar incidents.
    - Schedule recurring training sessions to educate team members on identifying and rectifying misconfigurations promptly.
